# Hello :wave:

# Idea 1 - How Are people Feeling in X? :smile:

---

- Hit the Twitter API, and the Google natural language service
- Run tweets from a region through the Language service
- Get the sentiment value
- Boom, you know (roughly) how people are feeling in that area
- Build frontend that allows people to query the api
- Profit $$$ etc

---

# Roadblock! :sweat:

- I wound up writing my own API.
- The assignment isn't about writing APIs

(demo)

---

# Idea 2 - Headspace :smile:

---

It's not easy to quickly find parks / greenspace, open space around sydney
- Add points to a google map
- Render the map
- Clicking pins will load the content into the sidebar
- clicking sidebar content will focus map
- etc

(demo)

# Roadblock! :sweat:
Google Maps is a piece of :poop:.
It's a mess of `new` and `this`. It hurt my brain.

---

# Idea 4 - Chat client! :smile:

---

- With `.on()` I could make a chat client!
- How to do CRUD easily?
- This was last night

---

# Idea 4 - Fuck it (aka address book) :poop:

---

It's an address book
- Pulls in user data from Firebase
- Renders a static map using the address
- You can add more entries, delete entries (CRUD basically)

(demo)

# Roadblock! :skull:
- I started it this morning. So uh, time was a problem.
- I forgot how to code. Seriously.

---

# What I've learned overall
- Doing really cool stuff with APIs is a lot easier server-side
- Being realistic is hard
- Start earlier
- Don't sweat the small stuff, just move on to another feature
